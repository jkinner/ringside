This distribution includes the following files, which comprise the Java library for interacting with the Facebook API:
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookRestClient.java
   -> main class of the library; your code should create an instance (xml or json) of this class and call its methods
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookJsonRestClient.java
   -> a FacebookRestClient that uses the JSON output format
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookXmlRestClient.java
   -> a FacebookRestClient that uses the XML output format
 - com/facebook/api/IFacebookRestClient.java -> an interface counterpart to the FacebookRestClient abstract class

 - com/facebook/api/FacebookMethod.java    -> enumeration of methods
 - com/facebook/api/IFacebookMethod.java   -> interface implemented by FacebookMethods and expected by FacebookRestClients
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookException.java -> very simple exception class
 - com/facebook/api/ProfileField.java      -> enumeration of profile fields

And the following classes, which may prove generally useful when developing Facebook applications:
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookExtendedPerm.java -> convenience class for dealing with extended permissions
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookParam.java        -> enumeration of parameters passed with callbacks from Facebook servers
 - com/facebook/api/FacebookSignatureUtil.java-> utility class for verifying FacebookParam's

For your convenience, bin/facebook.jar archive includes the compiled versions of the above classes

It also includes the following files showing example uses of the library:
 - com/facebook/api/ExampleClient.java
 - settings.conf

To use the ExampleClient:
 - Edit settings.conf and replace the api_key and secret with your own.
 - Make sure to add bin/BrowserLauncher2-10rc4.jar and bin/json_simple.jar to your classpath
   (for example, via 'java -cp "bin/BrowserLauncher2-10rc4.jar;bin/json_simple.jar" ').
