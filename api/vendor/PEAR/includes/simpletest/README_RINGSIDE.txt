All of simpletest is copied here, but the only change required is in url.php.

If you would prefer to run this version of simpletest, simply add the
vendors/PEAR/includes directory to your include_path

If you would prefer to run your own simpletest, make a backup of your url.php
(in case there are any significant changes), then copy the version in this
directory into your own installation
